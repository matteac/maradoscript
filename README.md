# MaradoScript
Inspired by Brainfuck and Maradona written in Rust

## How it works
It has a memory of 2^16 bytes and a pointer that points to the current byte, you can move the pointer forward or backward and increment or decrement the value at the pointer, print to the stdout and take input

Be careful! You can underflow and overflow the memory AND the pointer
If the pointer is at zero and you try to decrement it, it will go to the last byte


## Instructions
e - moves the pointer forward
i - moves the pointer backward 
m - increments the value at the pointer 
a - decrements the value at the pointer
üëç - outputs the value at the pointer to the stdout
  (space) - inputs an ASCII character rom the stdin and stores it at the pointer
